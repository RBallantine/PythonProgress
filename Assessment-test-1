# *** LISTS ***

# Build this list [0,0,0] in two seperate ways
#answer 1
my_list1 = [0,0,0,]

#answer 2
my_list2 = [0]*3

# Reassign 'hello' in this nested list to say 'Goodbye' instead
list3 = [1,2,[3,4,'hello']]

#Answer
list3[2][2] = 'Goodbye'

#Sort the list below
list4 = [5,3,4,6,1]

#Answer
list4.sort()


# *** DICTIONARIES ***

#Using keys and indexing, grab the 'hello' from the following dictionaries:
# Q1
d = {'simple_key':'hello'}

#Answer
d['simple_key']

# Q2
d = {'k1':{'k2':'hello'}}

#Asnwer
d['k1']['k2']

# Q3
d = {'k1':[{'nest_key':['this is deep',['hello']]}]}

#Answer
d['k1'][0]['nest_key'][1][0]

# Q4
d = {'k1':[1,2,{'k2':['this is tricky',{'tough':[1,2,['hello']]}]}]}

#Answer
d['k1'][2]['k2'][1]['tough'][2][0]

# Can you sort a dictionary?
#Answer: No, a dictionary is mappings of key value pairs, they are not a sequence such as a list.

# *** TUPLES *** 
#What is the major difference between tuples and lists?

#Answer: Tuples cannot be altered, they are immutable

# *** SETS ***
# What is unique about a set?

#Answer: They do not allow duplicate for items

#Use a set to find unique values of the list below
list5 = [1,2,2,33,4,4,11,22,3,3,2]

#Answer
set(list5)

#What is the boolean output for the code below?
l_one = [1,2,[3,4]]
l_two = [1,2,{'k1':4}]

l_one[2][0] >= l_two[2]['k1']

#Answer = false
